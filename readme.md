### CommandControllers & Scheduler

### Privacy Features

### Possible Enterprise Features

- Todo: Contacts (Import?)
- Todo: API (Im- and Export)
- Todo: A/B Tests
- Todo: SocialMedia Connection (Twitter)

## Technical requirements

lux needs minimum *TYPO3 8.7* as a modern basic together with *composer mode*. Every kind of form extension is supported
for the identification feature (powermail, form, formhandler, felogin, etc...).
At the moment it's not possible to use lux without **composer mode**!
